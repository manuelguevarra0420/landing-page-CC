					<p className="content">"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea 
					of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I 
					will give you a complete account of the system, and expound
					 the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
					 the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, 
					 or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because 
					 those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
					 consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone 
					 who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because 
					 it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which 
					 toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial 
					 example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, 
					 except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right 
					 to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has 
					 no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces 
					 no resultant pleasure?
